    "This came from a conversation in Dayton, OH with Madelyn while we were driving back from lunch with my Father - they were taking me back to work.  Madelyn and I were discussing how averages work and what they mean; the notepad I had scribbled on was an \"RLE Business Solutions\" notepad, which had \"RLE\" as a watermark.  Madelyn was asking about how many different 3-letter combinations exist.  We discussed and she asked \"Daddy can you show it in Jupyter like when you came to my class?\""
